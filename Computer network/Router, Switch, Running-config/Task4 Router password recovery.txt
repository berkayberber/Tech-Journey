Task4( Router password Recovery)

In order to recover a password we should have console connection between router and pc.

go to the router and power on the router and the click ctrlbreak (its room monitor mode that allows us to change the configuration register value.)

then we can change the configuration register value using the command 'confreg 0x2142' , and reload he router using the reset.

use command:
en
sh start   ( shows a enable encrypted secret password.)

copy start run  (copy the startup config file from the nvram to the ram)


now we can change the passwords:
use command :
conf t 
line console 0 
password burakberkay
login
exit
enable secret burakberkay   

config-register 0x2102            (now we shall set the register back to the default value to 2102)
ctrl+z                             save your configuration  
copy run start 
reload

now in order to have connection to the router we should use command:
conf t
int f0/0
no shut
