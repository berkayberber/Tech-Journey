# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This directory contains various artificial intelligence projects:

- **CoffeeMaker**: 
The CoffeeMaker project is an expert system developed using the Experta library in Python, designed to diagnose and resolve common issues with coffee makers. Utilizing a forward-chaining inference mechanism, the system processes various error codes and their associated causes to suggest appropriate actions for users. By representing knowledge through facts and rules, the CoffeeMaker system provides an intuitive troubleshooting experience, enabling users to efficiently address problems such as blockages, overheating, and supply issues. This project showcases the application of rule-based systems in practical scenarios, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing user interaction with everyday appliances.
- **Halma_Game**: Halma is a strategic board game for two to four players, where the objective is to move all of your pieces across the board to the opposite corner. This implementation features a 16x16 board and allows for both human vs AI and AI vs AI gameplay. The game utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for AI decision-making, ensuring optimal moves for the computer player.
Features
- Play against an AI or another human player.
- AI uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for strategic gameplay.
- Interactive console interface for move input and board display.
- Score tracking and win condition checks.
- **Machine_Learning**: This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to classify t-shirt features using a dataset (t-shirts.csv). Key steps include data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. The project explores classification algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers, comparing their performance after normalization and standardization. The results illustrate the effectiveness of different preprocessing techniques and hyperparameters in enhancing model accuracy, offering insights into practical machine learning workflows.
- **Multilayer_Perception**: This project develops a joke recommendation system using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, leveraging the Jester dataset for user joke ratings. Jokes are encoded with the BERT model to convert text into numerical vectors, forming the basis for user rating predictions.
Project Highlights
Data Preparation: Extracts user and joke IDs, joke texts, and ratings. The joke texts are encoded into embeddings using the sentence_transformers library.
Dataset Creation: Prepares a CSV with user IDs, joke IDs, ratings, and joke embeddings.
Model Training: Trains an MLP model with default hyperparameters, measuring performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Learning Rate Impact: Tests different learning rates (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01) to evaluate effects on model performance, visualizing cost functions over epochs.
This project provides insights into recommendation systems and the effects of learning rates on training dynamics.
