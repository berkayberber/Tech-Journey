# Cyber Security

Welcome to the **Cyber Security** folder. This repository contains essential resources and documents related to various topics covered in our **Cyber Security** course. The focus is on cryptographic techniques, digital signatures, block ciphers, key sizes, and the critical concepts necessary for modern cybersecurity practices.

## Topics Covered
### Cryptographic Algorithms
We have explored several historical cryptographic algorithms and compared their effectiveness. Notable algorithms such as **DES**, **AES**, and **MARS** were discussed in depth to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

### Digital Signatures
A thorough analysis of **digital signatures** was conducted, including an assessment of their execution time. This helped us understand the practical implications of using digital signatures in real-world security systems.

### Block Ciphers
This section presents a **comparative study of block ciphers**, such as **DES**, **IDEA**, **AES**, and **MARS**. We examined these algorithms in terms of their **entropy** and overall **security** to identify the most reliable options.

### Key Sizes
We analyzed how **key size** impacts the strength of cryptographic systems. Larger keys are correlated with stronger encryption, making this topic essential for building secure systems.

### RSA Key Lengths
A detailed study of **RSA encryption** was conducted, focusing on how **key length** affects both **entropy** and the security of encrypted data. This analysis is critical when deciding the appropriate key length for secure communications.

### SSL/TLS
We investigated the configurations of **SSL** and **TLS** protocols, exploring their roles in securing **data communications** over the internet. A proper understanding of SSL/TLS is vital for implementing secure web services and applications.

## Conclusion
These documents contain in-depth explanations, research, and comparisons of various encryption techniques and their applications in modern cybersecurity. The resources in this folder provide valuable insights into encryption and security measures critical for protecting data.
