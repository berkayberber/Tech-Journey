Cyber Security

Welcome to the Cyber Security folder. This folder contains key resources and documents related to topics we covered in our Cyber Security class, focusing on encryption, cryptographic algorithms, digital signatures, and related security concepts.

Topics Covered:
Cryptographic Algorithms: We explored historical cryptographic algorithms and compared their effectiveness. Key algorithms such as DES, AES, and MARS were discussed.

Digital Signatures: A deep dive into digital signature execution and its time assessment was carried out to understand the practical implications of using digital signatures in security systems.

Block Ciphers: A comparative study of block ciphers, including DES, IDEA, AES, and MARS, focusing on their entropy and security.

Key Sizes: We analyzed the impact of key size on cryptographic security, exploring how the strength of encryption increases with larger key sizes.

RSA Key Lengths: We studied RSA encryption and how key length affects entropy and the overall security of encrypted data.
SSL/TLS: We examined server configurations and the roles of SSL and TLS in securing data communications over the internet.
